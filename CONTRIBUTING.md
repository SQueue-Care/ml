## Project Overview

This is an **Intelligent Hospital Queue Management System** developed for the 2026 Coding Camp powered by DBS Foundation. The system includes:

- **Frontend**: Patient portal & admin dashboard
- **Backend**: RESTful APIs for queue management
- **ML Model**: Wait time prediction system
- **Database**: Patient, doctor, schedule, and queue data management
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud deployment (Vercel, Render/Railway, Supabase/Neon)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher) - for ML model development
- Git
- GitHub account with access to [SQueue-Care organization](https://github.com/SQueue-Care)
- Postman or similar tool for API testing (optional)

### First-Time Setup
1. **Request access** to [SQueue-Care organization](https://github.com/SQueue-Care) if you don't have it
2. **Clone the repository** (use the specific repo for your area: fs, ds, or ai):
   ```bash
   # Example for full-stack repo
   git clone https://github.com/SQueue-Care/fs-repo.git
   cd fs-repo
   ```
3. **Set up git remotes** (optional, if you have a personal fork):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/fs-repo.git
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/SQueue-Care/fs-repo.git
   ```
4. **Follow Development Setup section** below

---

## Contributing Workflow

### Step 1: Find or Create an Issue

#### Option A: Working on Existing Issues
1. Check the Issues board in your repository (fs, ds, or ai)
2. Look for issues with labels:
   - `fs` - Full Stack development tasks
   - `ds` - Data Science / ML tasks
   - `ai` - AI/ML model tasks

#### Option B: Reporting a Bug or Proposing a Feature
1. **Check existing issues** first to avoid duplicates
2. **Click "New Issue"** and choose a template:
   - **Bug Report**: Include steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior
   - **Feature Request**: Explain the problem it solves and proposed solution
3. Wait for feedback from maintainers
4. Once approved, you can claim it

### Step 2: Set Up Your Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local develop branch (primary development branch)
git fetch origin
git checkout develop
git merge origin/develop

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Important:** Always base your feature branches off the **`develop`** branch, not `main`
- `develop` - Active development branch (integration point)
- `main` - Production-ready releases only

### Step 3: Development Setup

Follow the **Development Setup** section below to:
- Install dependencies
- Configure environment variables
- Set up databases (local or cloud)
- Run tests and validation

### Step 4: Make Your Changes

#### For Backend Changes:
1. Write code in the appropriate module
2. Add/update unit tests
3. Test your changes locally
4. Ensure API docs are updated if endpoints change

#### For Frontend Changes:
1. Follow React/component structure conventions
2. Add tests for new components
3. Ensure responsive design
4. Test in different browsers

#### For ML Model Changes:
1. Document model changes and accuracy metrics
2. Include training/evaluation scripts
3. Update prediction API if needed

### Step 5: Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test          # Frontend tests
python -m pytest  # Backend tests

# Run linting
npm run lint      # Frontend linting
flake8 src/      # Backend linting

# Manual testing (if applicable)
# - Test in local environment
# - Use Postman for API endpoints
# - Create test cases
```

### Step 6: Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add queue optimization algorithm"
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only

**Examples:**
```
feat(queue): add wait time prediction algorithm
fix(auth): resolve JWT token expiration issue
docs(api): update queue endpoint documentation
test(queue): add test cases for patient distribution
```

### Step 7: Push and Create a Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch to origin
git push origin feature/queue-optimization

# Go to GitHub (https://github.com/SQueue-Care/[repo-name]) and create a Pull Request
# - Set base branch to 'develop' (NOT main)
# - Link the issue: "Fixes #123" or "Closes #123"
# - Fill in the PR template
# - Request reviews from maintainers
# - Add appropriate label: ds, fs, or ai
```

### Step 8: Address Review Feedback

1. **Read reviewer comments** carefully
2. **Make requested changes** locally
3. **Commit with descriptive messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "refactor: improve queue sorting logic as per review"
   ```
4. **Push updates**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/queue-optimization
   ```
5. **Respond to comments** in the PR discussion
6. **Request re-review** when ready

## Code Standards

### General Standards
- **Readability**: Code should be self-explanatory; use meaningful variable names
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - reuse code where possible
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, not obvious code
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Variables/functions: `camelCase` (JavaScript), `snake_case` (Python)
  - Classes/Components: `PascalCase`
  - Constants: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`

### Frontend (React)
```javascript
// Good: Clear component name, functional component
const PatientQueueCard = ({ queueNumber, estimatedWaitTime }) => {
  return (
    <div className="queue-card">
      <h3>Queue #{queueNumber}</h3>
      <p>Wait time: {estimatedWaitTime} mins</p>
    </div>
  );
};

// Use hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext
// Keep components small and focused
// One component per file unless very small
```

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
```python
# Good: Clear function name, type hints, docstring
def calculate_estimated_wait_time(queue_length: int, avg_service_time: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate estimated wait time for a patient.
    
    Args:
        queue_length: Number of patients in queue
        avg_service_time: Average service time in minutes
        
    Returns:
        Estimated wait time in minutes
    """
    return queue_length * avg_service_time

# Use type hints
# Include docstrings for public functions/classes
# Keep functions focused on one responsibility
```

### ML Model (Python)
```python
# Document model architecture and training process
# Include model versioning and performance metrics
# Use clear variable names for model parameters
```

---

## Testing

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend

# Run tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# E2E testing (if applicable)
npm run test:e2e
```

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend

# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=.

# Make sure develop is up to date
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop

# Push your feature branch
git push origin feature/description

# Create PR targeting 'develop' branch at:
# https://github.com/SQueue-Care/[repo-name]/compare/develop...feature/description
```

### Rebasing Before PR
```bash
# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git rebase -i origin/develop

# Force push (use carefully!)
git push origin feature/description --force-with-lease
```

### Squashing Commits
```bash
# If maintainer asks to squash
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # For last 3 commits
# Mark commits as 'squash' or 's'
# Save and resolve conflicts if any
git push origin feature/description --force-with-lease
```

## Project Structure Reference

SQueue-Care has multiple repositories organized by team:

```text
SQueue-Care Organization (https://github.com/SQueue-Care)
├── frontend/                 # Frontend repository (currently empty)
├── backend/                  # Backend repository (currently empty)
└── ai/                       # AI/ML repository (currently empty)
```

**Key Points:**
- Each repository has `main` and `develop` branches
- Always work from the `develop` branch
- Use labels `fs`, `ds`, or `ai` to categorize issues
- PRs should target the `develop` branch

## Tips for Success

**Do:**
- Read the PRD and understand the project goals
- Check existing issues before starting
- Write clear, focused commits
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Document as you code
- Ask for help when stuck
- Review other PRs and learn from them

**Don't:**
- Work without an assigned issue
- Create large PRs with many unrelated changes
- Commit to main directly
